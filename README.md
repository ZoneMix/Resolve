# Resolve
Project Resolve is a project working on the device fingerprinting of rogue IoT devices. This tool is meant to be open-source and used by the community.

### Written in Python 3.8.2

## Welcome to Project Resolve

This project is a branch off of a project called [bustaPcap](https://github.com/abaker2010/bustaPcap) by a former co-worker of mine [Aaron Baker](https://github.com/abaker2010). I made it for my cryptography class final project. Device fingerprinting can be hard, but I believe this is a step in the right direction to come out with a service that can constantly run real-time to track if an IoT device becomes rogue.

## Things To Do
- COMMENT CODE
- Filter for better accuracy of a rogue device
- Implement command-line args
- Eventually implement a machine learning aspect
- Create back-end db to connect to and save data
- Export to xls and json
- Separate the code and make it better to implement different classes and a main file
